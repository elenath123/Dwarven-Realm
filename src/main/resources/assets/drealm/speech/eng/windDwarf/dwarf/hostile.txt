Don't expect anything good, dwarves don't like bad guys!
You are no match for our clan! 
Get away,#!
I'll cut you in two!
Come on, man! Show me what you can do!
Feel the wrath of my people! 
Why did you come here? You want to get hit in the face with a hammer?
Enjoy your last minutes,#!
No! The treasure of the dwarves is not for you! 
Raaaargh! 
I will crush you like a stone!
You underestimated us, #!
Nasty little brat! 
What were you thinking, getting into a fight with me?
Woe and destruction to you and your people,#!
Khazâd ai-mênu!
Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul! 
You'll die, by the beard!
How dare you touch our land with your paws?
Get out, you bastard!
You will pay for selling your soul to the Dark Lord!
