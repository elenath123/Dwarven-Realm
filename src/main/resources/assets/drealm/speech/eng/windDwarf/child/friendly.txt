Welcome to us #! 
You're not one of Ironfists. 
Greetings! 
Soon I'll be able to drink dwarf ale. I can't wait!
Even my mother's beard is better than yours,#!
Can you give me dwarf ale while no one is looking? 
How are you, #? 
Aaaarrrrgh! 
They say I'm too young to fight! Ha!
I would like to wear my father's armor... 
One Day, I will have a big beard! 
There is no finer weapon than the dwarf axe,#! 
One day I will fight the Variag, side by side with my father.
