I don't like you. Get out of here! 
You're a bad person,#! 
Raaaaarrrgh!!!
If I had an axe, I would split your skull in two!
Even the oldest dwarves don't run from their enemies, just like me!
You better run before my father comes back with an axe! 
Go away, or you will face the wrath of my kind!
We dwarves know how to deal with ork-scum like you!
You must leave our lands! We dwarves will not tolerate monsters here!
Dark Lord's Litter! Crawl back to the door, or you'll fall into the mud and face my father's fury!
