I am proud to fight for your cause,#!
Let's kill a couple more orcs!
Ahchoo! Sneeze it means to be a battle.
Our enemies will be crushed by dwarven hammers, their ribs will crack like a burning log!
The dwarves ' axes are sharpened and ready to cut,#!
First we will shoot the enemy with bows, and then we will crush them with our hammers!
Winning is good, but I'm damn thirsty!
I would sell my beard and fight my enemies to drink a dwarven ale.
Oh, How I miss our magnificent halls! But a dwarf doesn't run from battle! I'll be back when we're done.
We dwarves are valiant warriors! All enemies will tremble under our hammers and axes!
There isn't a single enemy that survives my strike!
By my beard, I would defeat ten armies, fight a Troll, and all for one Cup of Ale!
It's really a great honor for me to fight for such a brave warrior like you,#!
